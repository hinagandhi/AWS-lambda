# AWS-lambda

# Summary:
Two files are written, the file upload-csv.go is to upload any CSV to s3 bucket which will trigger AWS lambda. Second file lambda-function.go is what AWS lambda will do: it will copy file to other s3 bucket. This was just a simple code that I wanted to wite to learn about AWS lambda and Go.

# Steps taken to run AWS lambda:
1. Add a trigger:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Select s3 from drop down
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Add bucket name, event type(in this case put) and then after filling all details, click on add
  
2. Handler name should be the file name. In this case, lambda-function

3. GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o lambda-function lambda-functio.go -> building binary file

4. zip the file `zip lambda.zip lambda-function`

5. Upload the zip file

6. Create permissions for function by going to:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles and create a new role and attach policies: `AmazonS3FullAccess` 
  and `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` and other policy which will have policy to create log stream and put log events.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Once role is created then select that role in execution role setion.
